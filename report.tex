\section*{Introduction}

We have carried out linkage analyses (lod-score or affected sib-pairs) 
and association analyses (case-control or familial) for a monogenic disease, then for a multifactorial disease:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Study of a monogenic disease: Clouston's disease
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Genetic linkage analysis (lodscore)
        \item Familial association analysis
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Study of a multifactorial disease: rheumatoid arthritis
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Genetic linkage analysis (affected sib-pairs)
        \item Genome-Wide case-control association analysis
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

 
The data and programs were provided by our professor VALÉRIE CHAUDRU.

\section{Monogenic disease: Clouston's disease}

Clouston syndrome is mainly characterized by abnormal nails (thickened, slow-growing, brittle) and alopecia (hair loss). \textit{Palmoplantar hyperkeratosis} (commonly known as horniness) is also sometimes observed. 
This is a rare disease, with a prevalence ranging from 1 to 9 in 100,000. It is autosomal dominant. Penetrance of the disease is complete, but its expression is variable, even in patients from the same family.
Our aim in this part of the analysis was to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Perform linkage analysis using the lodscore method to locate the Clouston disease gene using genetic markers located on chromosome 13.
    \item Interpret data from a \texttt{.vcf} file containing genetic variants identified in a case-control sample and perform association analysis for a candidate variant.
    \item Search for the causal genetic variant using familial association analysis.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Genetic linkage analysis - lodscore method}

We have analyzed the data contained in the \texttt{fam.txt} file using \texttt{paramlink} package in R.
